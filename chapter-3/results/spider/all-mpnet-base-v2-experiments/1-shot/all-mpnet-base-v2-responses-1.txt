SELECT The section `h` in the database schema represents a table named `Transcript_Contents`. This table is used to store the relationship between student course enrollments (`student_course_id`) and transcripts (`transcript_id`). It serves as a bridge table to link the courses a student has enrolled in with the transcripts that document their academic performance in those courses. The `student_course_id` column references the `student_course_id` in the `Student_Enrolment_Courses` table, while the `transcript_id` column references the `transcript_id` in the `Transcripts` table. This table helps maintain the integrity of the data and allows for efficient retrieval of information related to student course enrollments and transcripts.
